# SDG-Relationships
# Analyzing the Relationship Between Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Country-Level Performance

## Project Overview
This project examines how the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) influence a country's overall SDG Index score. Using statistical and machine learning methods, the study identifies high-impact goals to support policymakers in making data-driven decisions for sustainable development.

## Tools and Techniques Used
- **RStudio**
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Summary statistics  
- **Multiple Linear Regression**  
- **Decision Tree Modeling**  
- Data visualizations

# Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA was conducted to identify trends, correlations, and outliers among SDG scores. Insights guided the modeling process and highlighted high-impact SDGs contributing to the overall SDG Index.

## Modeling and Analysis

### **Multiple Linear Regression**
- Analyzed how each SDG score contributes to the SDG Index  
- Quantified the relative influence of each goal  

### **Decision Tree**
- Identified the most influential SDGs  
- Highlighted segmentation among countries based on SDG performance  
- Provided an interpretable flow of goal interactions

## Results and Findings of Decision Tree

### **Goal 1 – No Poverty**
- Countries scoring below **47** face major poverty challenges.  
- Many also struggle with Goal 6 (Clean Water).  
- Represents 55 observations (18% of the dataset).

### **Goal 3 – Good Health and Well-being**
- 34% of countries score below **58**, indicating healthcare gaps.  
- Strong interaction with clean water and sanitation indicators.

### **Goal 4 – Quality Education**
- Scores below **42** are correlated with issues in urban sustainability.  

### **Goal 6 – Clean Water and Sanitation**
- Scores below **78** cluster with low-poverty performance groups.  
- Represents 46% of countries with water challenges.

### **Goal 11 – Sustainable Cities**
- Scores below **33** highlight urban planning issues.

### **Goal 17 – Partnerships**
- Essential for cross-border development and resource sharing.

## Insights and Recommendations

### **Goal 1 – No Poverty**
- Strengthen integrated poverty reduction and sanitation programs.

### **Goal 3 – Good Health**
- Build healthcare infrastructure and improve preventive services.

### **Goal 4 – Quality Education**
- Expand educational access and improve urban education systems.

### **Goal 6 – Clean Water**
- Invest in water treatment, sanitation infrastructure, and awareness.

### **Goal 8 – Technology Transfer**
- Encourage global collaborations to support sustainable development.

### **Goal 11 – Sustainable Cities**
- Focus on urban planning and climate-resilient infrastructure.

### **Goal 17 – Partnerships**
- Facilitate international cooperation and cross-sector collaboration.

## Overall Strategic Recommendations
- Leverage **cross-goal synergies** (poverty ↔ water, education ↔ cities).  
- Build **country-specific development programs**.  
- Develop **policy priorities** that amplify SDG-driven global partnerships.

---

## Limitations
- Does not incorporate the weighted SDG Index formula.  
- Cross-sectional data limits time-based insights.  
- SDG performance interpretation may vary by stakeholder.
